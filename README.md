# 🏅 Olympics Data Engineering Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **data engineering pipeline** for Olympics data, leveraging **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2, Databricks, and PySpark**. It cleans, processes, and analyzes Olympics data to generate **insightful statistics on athlete performance, country-wise success, and event participation trends**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)** → Stores raw and processed data
- **Databricks & PySpark** → Handles data ingestion, transformation, and analysis
- **Delta Lake** → Stores clean, optimized data for querying
- **Python & Spark SQL** → Used for insights and reporting
